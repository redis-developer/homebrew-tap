# Homebrew Formulae

## How do I install these formulae?
Invoke either of the following commands if the formula is hosted at GitHub

```sh
$ brew install redis-developer/tap/<formula>
```

Or

```sh
$ brew tap redis-developer/tap
$ brew install <formula>
```

Invoke the following command if the formula is *not* hosted at GitHub

```sh
brew tap redis-developer/homebrew-tap 
brew install <formula>
```
